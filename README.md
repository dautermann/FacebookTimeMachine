Use a time machine to meet Nobel laureates!

## Getting started
Type in coordinates (e.g. 37.3318, -122.0312) and you'll see a city appear in the table. Click on the city name and start traveling!

You can also type in a place name and it'll auto complete and populate the initial city table.  Any places that appear do have coordinates associated with them.  To do proper city name autocomplete, I would have to bring in G00gle API's which I wasn't in the mood to do.

As you travel through time, watch your fuel level drop.

## Things I wish I could've done (but couldn't do because real life / job got in the way)

display nobel prize details even better

color the cells (green, red, yellow/orange for "dangerous" travel) to indicate whether we have enough fuel to travel

implement a real fuel gage (like a progress bar?)

bring in MapKit for reals!
